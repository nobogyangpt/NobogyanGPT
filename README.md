# Vision NoboGyanGPT

This is not a company. This is a spark.

We aim to create an open, ethical, and deeply Indian AI ecosystem where:

- Knowledge flows in Bengali, Hindi, Tamil, Assamese...
- Innovation doesn’t need IIT degrees or venture capital
- Contributions come from villages and metros alike

Our vision is to create:
- Tools that explain science to students in their own language
- Bots that translate Indian culture, values, and learning
- A culture of building — not just consuming — AI

Even if our tools are small, our intent is vast.

This is for the next generation of Indian builders.

Let’s begin, together.
