# NoboGyanGPT Commons

**An open-source AI initiative to build India's tech culture.**

We are not here to compete. We are here to create.  
NoboGyanGPT Commons is a humble initiative to open the doors of AI innovation to Indian students, teachers, and rural tech minds — using local languages, open tools, and community power.
