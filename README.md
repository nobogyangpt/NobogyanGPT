# NoboGyanGPT Commons

**An open-source AI initiative to build India's tech culture.**

We are not here to compete.  
We are here to create.  
NoboGyanGPT Commons is a humble initiative to open the doors of AI innovation to Indian students, teachers, and rural tech minds — using local languages, open tools, and community power.

## Why This Project?

Most AI tools are built by global giants, focusing on English and well-resourced markets.  
We want a **small, local, open** alternative: starting with West Bengal Board’s Bengali medium, while simultaneously supporting Hindi, Tamil, Assamese, and other major & regional languages across India.

## What You’ll Find Here

1. **Lightweight AI Demo Projects** covering Class 0–12 syllabi (WBSE, WBCHSE, ICSE, CBSE, NCERT, and others).
2. **Tools** for creating Indic-language datasets and fine-tuning AI models.
3. **Beginner-Friendly Tutorials** in Bengali, Hindi, English, and other regional languages.
4. **A Call for Collaboration & Mentorship** to build together — students, teachers, NGOs, self-learners.
