# NoboGyanGPT Commons

**An open-source AI initiative to build India's tech culture.**

We are not here to compete. We are here to create.  
NoboGyanGPT Commons is a humble initiative to open the doors of AI innovation to Indian students, teachers, and rural tech minds — using local languages, open tools, and community power.

## Why This Project?

Most AI tools today are built by tech giants for global use. We want to build a small, open, and local version — for students in Bengal, Bihar, Nagaland, Kerala — who want to learn, build, and dream in their own language.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Lightweight AI demo projects (NCERT QA, Language Tools)
- Tools for creating Indic-language datasets
- Beginner-friendly tutorials in Hindi/English
- A call for open collaboration and mentorship

## Who Can Join?

- Students (any stream, any level)
- Self-learners and YouTubers
- Teachers and educators
- Small NGOs or community tech groups
