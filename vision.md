# Vision: NoboGyanGPT Commons

This is not a company. This is a culture spark.

- **Prioritize**: Begin by serving **Bengali-medium** West Bengal Board students (Pre-Primary through Class XII).
- **Simultaneous Reach**: From day one, extend full support in **Hindi, Tamil, Assamese, and other major and regional Indian languages**.
- **Open & Ethical**: All code, datasets, and tutorials are public — anyone can contribute, learn, and build.
- **Deeply Indian**: Knowledge flows in Indian tongues, without dependence on foreign tech or big budgets.

**Our vision** is to ignite a self-sustaining, community-driven AI ecosystem where:
1. Students learn in their mother tongue.
2. Teachers gain free, AI-powered tools tailored to local curricula.
3. Rural and urban tech minds collaborate equally.

Even if our tools are small, our intent is vast. This is for the next generation of Indian builders.
